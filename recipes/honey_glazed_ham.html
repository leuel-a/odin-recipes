        <h3>How to make Honey Glazed Ham?</h3>
        <p>
            Use a sharp knife to score the ham (in other words, make criss-cross slashes). Stud the ham evenly with cloves. Heat the honey, corn syrup, and butter in a double boiler to make the glaze. Brush the glaze over the ham and bake in a foil-lined pan for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, brushing every 15 minutes or so with the glaze. Broil the ham for a few minutes before removing it from the oven.
